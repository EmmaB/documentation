# GitHub


With Codeanywhere, you’ll be able to work directly with your GitHub repositories. 

### Creating an GitHub Container

Go to File -> New Connection -> GitHub. 

![github-open](images/github-open.png "github-open")

After selecting it, Add GitHub Access window appears. Click on "Connect your GitHub Account" in order to proceed.

![github-connect](images/github-connect.png "github-connect")


Enter your GitHub account details to connect to your GitHub account and authorize Codeanywhere for quick and easy access.
 
![githubauth](images/githubauth.png "githubauth")

You’ll be prompted which repository you want to connect to.

![github-repo](images/github-repo.png "github-repo")

Just select repository you want to access, setup your development environment, or let our system decide for you!

![github-repo2](images/github-repo2.png "github-repo2")

Now you’ve created a new [Container](http://docs.codeanywhere.com/connections/container.html) with your repository!

Once you have got the repo in Codeanywhere, you can work on it from anywhere. You'll be able to edit your files, or run projects within Codeanywhere!

### Accessing GitHub Organizations

You have to explicitly allow Codeanywhere to access your organizations. You can do it in two ways:

1.) During authorization process
Click Grant / Request Access on organization which repositories you want to access through Codeanywhere
