# Bitbucket

With Codeanywhere, you’ll be able to work directly with your Bitbucket repositories. 

### Creating an Bitbucket Container

Go to File -> New Connection -> Bitbucket:

![bitbucket-open](images/bitbucket-open.png "bitbucket-open")

After selecting it, Add Bitbucket Access window appears. Click on "Connect your Bitbucket Account" in order to proceed.

![bitbucket-connect](images/bitbucket-connect.png "bitbucket-connect")

Enter Bitbucket details to connect to your Bitbucket account and authorize Codeanywhere for quick and easy access.

![bitbucket-authorize](images/bitbucket-authorize.png "bitbucket-authorize")

You’ll be prompted which repository you want to connect to.

![bitbucket-repo](images/bitbucket-repo.png "bitbucket-repo")

Now just select repository you want to access, setup your development environment, or let our system decide for you!
Now you’ve created a new [Container](http://docs.codeanywhere.com/connections/container.html) with your repository!

Once you have got the repo in Codeanywhere, you can work on it from anywhere. You'll be able to edit your files, or run projects within Codeanywhere!
