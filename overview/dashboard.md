# Dashboard

You can access your Dashboard from inside your Editor – just go to top menu bar and in right corner select Profile Button – or go directly to https://codeanywhere.com/dashboard.

Here, you can take care of all your Account details – manage your password, connect to various networks (GitHub, Bitbucket, Google or Facebook), and Delete your Account.

Under Billing, you can manage your subscriptions and purchase add-ons, check out your invoices and billing info. Also, as a security measure, here you can activate 2FA (for Freelancer Plan and higher).

With our share feature you can work on a code with other Codeanywhere users. Now, you can access all your shares from your Dashboard – Shared with me will show you all the shares you've received and in My shares, you can see all the shares you have made!
