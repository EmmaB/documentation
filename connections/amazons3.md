# Amazon S3

Amazon's S3 is integrated into Codeanywhere just as FTP, Dropbox, and Google Drive. 

### Creating Amazon S3 connection

Go to File -> New Connections -> Amazon S3.

![amazons3-open](images/amazons3-open.png "amazons3-open")

After selecting it, enter credentials of your S3 Bucket:

![amazons3-connect](images/amazons3-connect.png "amazons3-connect")

- Server - name of your AmazonS3 Server
- Bucket - name of your AmazonS3 Bucket
- Access Key ID - a alphanumeric text string that uniquely identifies the user who owns the account
- Secret Access Key - password of an AmazonS3 account

If the S3 account is added successfully it will appear in your File Explorer with the S3 icon.
