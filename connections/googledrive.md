If the Google Drive account is added successfully it will appear in your File Explorer with the Google Drive icon.
Now you can easily edit files from your Google Drive account!

If you receive an Invalid Token error, it means there is something wrong with your long-term access token, so please try removing and adding your Drive account. If that does not work please try revoking access to Codeanywhere from your Google security page located at: https://www.google.com/settings/security and afterwards try to add it again.
