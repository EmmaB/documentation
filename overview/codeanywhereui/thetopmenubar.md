It allows you to go to your [Dashboard](http://docs.codeanywhere.com/overview/dashboard.html) - where you can view your subscriptions, projects and shares, change your password or delete your account - or to log off from the Editor, returning you to the Codeanywhere [homepage](http://www.codeanywhere.com).
